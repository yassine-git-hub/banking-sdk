# Welcome on BankingSDK, the PSD2/OpenBanking open source solution to connect to bank APIs.

To start using BankingSDK, you have to :

## 1. Create an account.

Go to https://developer.bankingsdk.com
Create your account and specify your company information.
The Developer portal is used to do telemtry on your usage and log issues in the calls to bank APIs.
You can invite your colleagues to share the same workspace and log information.

## 2. Download the latest SDK version.

Use either the GitHub repo, fork it or download it or you can download a binary DLL file directly from the developer portal.
DLLs from the developer portal have been tested and validated by the Core Team.
Using the GitHub version is fine for development/testing purpose.

## 3. Read the documentation / Sample code.

PDF documentation file is available from Download page of the developer portal.
In the GitHub repo, you can find two test programs. One is a console app while the second is a webapp.
Both are examples of how to use bankingSDK's DLL version.

You're started!

## 4. In need of a new connector?

Simply fork the GitHub repo and have a look at an already up and running connector like the BE_KBC one.
This will give you a correct overview of the job you have to do.
This is a 2 days work or something like that. Contact us for more help if needed. We are working on a "step-by-step" documenation of what you need to do to add a new connector. It's coming! ;)
